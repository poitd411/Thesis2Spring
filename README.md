Thesis 2 Spring Delaney Poitras

My thesis is an exploration of humans and civilization throughout time. It is an exploration of early philosophical thought in comparison to science and how the world physically became what it is today. I compare people such as Hegel to concepts like the Big Bang; I compare architecture to civilization. These comparisons, while utilizing design in the form of a bound book, intend to show differing of opinions as to how the world came to be, in very unmanageable, unbite-size pieces. The intention isnâ€™t for the book to necessary be read front to back, but it can be picked up and started on any page, since each spread discusses different ideas and only short excerpts from each of the texts chosen.
